  //JavaScript has built-in constructors for native objects:
  new String()    // A new String object
  new Number()    // A new Number object
  new Boolean()   // A new Boolean object
  new Object()    // A new Object object
  new Array()     // A new Array object
  new RegExp()    // A new RegExp object
  new Function()  // A new Function object
  new Date()      // A new Date object 
//Math() object is not in the list. Math is a global object. The new keyword cannot be used on Math.


/*Use string literals "" instead of new String().

Use number literals 50 instead of new Number().

Use boolean literals true / false instead of new Boolean().

Use object literals {} instead of new Object().

Use array literals [] instead of new Array().

Use pattern literals /()/ instead of new RegExp().

Use function expressions () {} instead of new Function().


there is no reason to create complex objects. Primitive values are much faster:i.e  var num=50 is more perfect than new Number(50)*/

const x4 = {};           // new Object object,Use object literals {} instead of new Object().
const x5 = [];           // new Array object,Use array literals [] instead of new Array().
const x6 = /()/          // new RegExp object,Use pattern literals /()/ instead of new RegExp().
const x7 = function(){}; // new function ,Use function expressions () {} instead of new Function().
